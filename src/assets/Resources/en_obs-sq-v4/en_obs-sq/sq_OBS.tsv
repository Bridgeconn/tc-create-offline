front	vj0h	intro				# A Guide to Using the Stories in the OBS\n\n## The Reason for the Stories\n\nThe stories in the OBS tell about things that happened in the Bible. However, the stories are shorter than the Bible accounts, and the language is often easier to understand. The stories can help people learn about who God is and about what he has done. Also, each paragraph of a story has an image that can help people understand what happened in Bible times when clothing, houses, and culture were very different than they are today.\n\n## The Parts of the Stories\n\nThe Stories in the OBS can be used by individuals or groups of people who want to learn about God. The OBS includes several things to help people use the stories:\n\n- The text of the stories\n- The images in the stories\n- The study notes in the stories\n- The questions for the stories\n\n## How to Use the Stories\n\nWe suggest you use the stories in the following way:\n\n1. **Choose a story to read.** The stories will be easier to understand if you read the stories in order, beginning with the first story.\n1. **Read the story.** In a group, one person may read the story aloud, or the people may take turns reading portions.\n1. **Look at the images.** Use the images to help you understand what happened in the time of the story. Try to identify the people in the images.\n1. **Refer to the Notes.** Read the study notes whenever there is a word or something else that you do not understand in the story.\n1. **Discuss the Questions.** Read each question and think about the answer. The first set of questions help you see what the story says. The next set of questions help you think about what the story means to you. If you are in a group, allow different people to offer answers to the questions. Look at the answer to each question and see how it is the same as your answer, or different from it.\n1. **Read the Summary.** Read the story summary at the end of the questions. Think about what you have learned about God in the story. If you are in a group, ask the group what they have learned from the story.\n

1:11	ypnk	application			Why do you think God put the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden when he did not want Adam to eat its fruit?	God wanted Adam to be able to choose whether or not to obey God. Therefore, God planted the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden where Adam was. However, he warned Adam clearly that he would die if he ate fruit from that tree. And God allowed Adam to eat fruit from every other tree, so there was no reason for Adam to disobey God (See: [1:11](01/11)).
1:12-14	jl8m	meaning			What did God do so that the man would not be alone?	God wanted Adam to have a helper who would be like Adam.

1:14	ndh8	application			How do you think a man becomes one with his wife?	God wants a man and his wife to have a special bond that is closer than their connection to any other person.

1:16	tqz7	application			What did God want people to do on the seventh day?	God made the seventh day a special day. On that day, he wanted people to stop doing their normal work. Instead, they should remember that God created them and everything around them. Because they would not work on the seventh day, they would have more time to honor God and think about him than they did on the other days of the week (See: [1:16](01/16)).
1:1-16	kn32	summary				God created everything that exists. He simply spoke, and the entire universe appeared out of nothing. However, God formed the first man and woman in a more personal way. He breathed life into the man, and then formed the woman from the man. God wanted people to be like him in ways that animals are not.

Eve did not care that it was God who told her not to eat the fruit, or that God told her not to eat it in order to protect her.
2:6-7	m4lz	application			Why do you think Adam and Eve tried to cover their shame and hid from God?	When they disobeyed God by eating the fruit, they became sinners. They were so ashamed that they did not want God to see them.

2:9-11	bu7f	application			How did the curses match the way that Adam, Eve, and the snake disobeyed God?	Adam ate the fruit, so God made it difficult for him to grow food. Eve caused Adam to sin, so God gave Adam power over Eve. The snake spoke as if he were wiser than God, so God made him crawl on his belly.
2:12	ft2u	application			Why was it bad for Adam and Eve to know good and evil?	Their knowledge of good and evil was knowledge gained by personal experience. That experience of making an evil choice caused them to be separated from God. Their fellowship with him was broken (See: [2:12](02/12)).
2:1-12	riav	summary				God provided everything Adam and Eve needed in the garden. The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was the only thing they could not have. The snake convinced Eve that God did not want them to be wise, and that was why God told them not to eat the fruit. So Adam and Eve disobeyed God and sinned by eating the fruit. They immediately were ashamed and hid from God. God cursed Adam, Eve, and the snake because of what they had done. Then God drove them out of the garden so they would not eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever as sinners. But God also promised him that a descendant of the woman would later come and kill the snake.

3:4	r4bp	application			Why was no one else besides Noah’s family ready when the flood came?	The boat was very large, and it took Noah and his sons a very long time to build it. Many other people would have seen Noah building the boat and would have asked him about it.

3:5	gn1v	meaning			How many people entered into the boat?	Eight people entered into the boat—Noah and his wife, and his three sons and their wives. No one else believed the flood would happen (See: [3:4](03/04), [3:5](03/05)).

Noah lived in a time when almost everyone was wicked. In spite of that, Noah honored God, and taught his family to honor him as well. Therefore, God made a way for Noah and his family to escape God’s punishment. Noah obeyed God. He built the boat and took his family into it.

Noah continued to honor God, and God promised never to destroy the earth with a flood again.

4:2-3	g19c	meaning			Why did God change their language?	God changed their one language into many languages so they could not understand each other (See: [4:3](04/03)). As a result, they could not work together to continue building the tower or living together well. So they spread out over the earth in different language groups.
4:3	o7p6	application			Why do people today speak different languages?	People today speak different languages because God gave them different languages at Babel (See: [4:3](04/03)). He wanted each language group to spread out across the earth and learn to honor him.

4:7	nvwe	meaning			Why did Abram give a tenth of his possessions to Melchizedek?	Melchizedek was a priest of God (See: [4:7](04/07)). That is, he spoke for God and helped people worship God. Abram gave a tenth of his possessions to Melchizedek as an offering to God. In this way, Abram honored God.
4:8-9	ortw	application			Why was God’s promise to Abram so surprising?	God promised that Abram would have more descendants then the stars in the sky. No one is able to count all the stars!

4:8	eve3	meaning			Why might it have been difficult for Abram to believe that he would have many descendants?	Abram and Sarai did not yet have a son (See: [4:8](04/08)). Without a son, he could not have many descendants.

So only the family of Noah survived to fill the earth. Although Noah obeyed God, he was not perfect. He received wicked desires from his ancestors, Adam and Eve. And he passed these on to his descendants.
4:1-9	f7fy	summary				Many descendants were soon born to Noah. But, even though Noah was a righteous man, his descendants did not obey God. They refused to fill the earth. Instead, they built a city and a tower to honor themselves. Therefore, God confused their language so they would separate into groups. Later, God chose Abram and promised to bless every language group through his descendants. Abram believed God would do this, even though he did not have a son. Therefore, God was pleased with Abram and declared him righteous.
5:1	l0va	meaning			Why did Sarai tell Abram to have a child with Hagar?	Sarai was now too old to have children (See: [5:1](05/01)). The custom of that time allowed a woman to have a child through their servant.
5:1	s99f	application			Should Sarai have told Abram to have a son with her servant Hagar?	The custom of the day allowed Sarai to have a son through her servant. But perhaps Sarai did this because she did not believe God could give Abram a son in their old age.

While the babies were in Rebekah’s womb, God had already caused them to be the kind of people that he wanted them to be. They would continue to struggle with each other throughout their lives.

6:1-7	y8i0	summary				Abraham wanted to make sure that his son Isaac married a woman who believed in God, and not a woman who served idols. Therefore, he sent his servant far away to the land of his relatives to find the right wife for Isaac. God directed Abraham’s servant to Rebekah, who trusted God. After Isaac married Rebekah, they could not have children. But God answered Isaac’s prayer and she became pregnant with twin boys. Even while they were in her womb, God told Rebekah that they would become two nations, and that the nation from the older son would obey the nation from the younger son.

It would certainly seem reasonable that Zechariah doubted the angel, because God had not spoken to his people for 400 years. However, God did not merely send a prophet to Zechariah. Instead, he sent one of his mighty angels. The presence of the angel should have convinced Zechariah to believe the message.
22:4-5	iu4q	application			Mary was a virgin. Therefore, her son did not have a human father. Why do you think this was important?	Every descendant of Adam and Eve is born with a desire to sin.

23:3	bw07	application			Why did Joseph not sleep with Mary until the baby was born?	God told Joseph that Mary was a virgin and that the baby inside her was from God.

Therefore, he left them and went away to preach to other people in Galilee. Many saw the works he did and believed in him.

27:1	ad2l	application			Why was it surprising that Jesus asked the expert in the Jewish law about what was written in God’s law?	The man knew far more about the Jewish law than any other person in Israel. He continually studied it and taught it to others. However, he did not really understand what the law meant. Therefore, Jesus started questioning him about the law so that he could show the man that he did not really know what God’s law taught.
27:3	m9m8	application			Why do you think the man asked Jesus who his neighbor was?	The man knew God’s law said to love his neighbor as himself. But he also knew that he did not love other people as he should. Therefore, he asked about his neighbor because he was hoping that he only needed to love a few specific people in order to obey the law.
27:6-7	mdt2	application			Why might Jesus have chosen to talk to this man about a priest and a Levite?	The Jews considered the priests and Levites to be the most spiritual people in Israel. They also considered the experts in the law to be very much like the priests and the Levites. Because the experts studied and taught God’s law, people assumed they knew more about God than other people did.
27:8-11	jgcz	application			Why might the expert in the Jewish law have been offended when Jesus compared the actions of the priest and the Levite to the actions of the Samaritan?	The expert in the Jewish law considered the priests and the Levites to be good people, but he hated the Samaritan. He thought all Samaritans were sinners.

27:8-10	jeb2	application			How much did the Samaritan show mercy to the injured man?	The Samaritan did not merely help the injured man a little bit. Instead, he did more for the injured man than anyone would expect him to do. He bandaged him, took him to the inn, and paid all of the expenses for the man.
27:11	feqb	application			What does the story tell us about loving our neighbor?	The Samaritan saw another person who had a serious need. Although the man was a stranger from a people that the Samaritans hated, he felt compassion for him. He took care of the man, doing more than was necessary or expected to help him. He treated the injured man as he would like to be treated himself if he was in need. This is what it means to be a neighbor to someone.
27:1-11	qy7s	summary				The expert in the law who came to Jesus did not believe in Jesus, and he did not really understand God’s law. Instead, he wanted to embarrass Jesus. Jesus knew this, and so he questioned the man about the law. He then told a story that showed how a follower of God should treat other people. God gives eternal life to people who believe in him and obey him, rather than to people who hold powerful religious positions. When the simple Samaritan was merciful to the injured man, he acted more like God than do the most religious people in Israel.
28:1	q5su	meaning			What did the rich young ruler want Jesus to tell him?	The rich young ruler wanted Jesus to tell him how he could have eternal life. He wanted to live forever with God (See: [28:1](28/01)).

28:2-3	d2zc	application			Why did the young man ask which laws he must obey?	The young man did not understand that people must obey all of God’s laws. God considers that we sin if we fail to obey even one of his laws. The young man wrongly thought that God would accept him if he faithfully obeyed some of God’s most important laws.
28:4	ld7w	application			Why did Jesus talk to the young man about being perfect?	The young man wrongly thought he could be ‘good enough’ to have eternal life. Jesus wanted him to know that he had to be perfect—that is, without any sin—in order to have eternal life. He could not keep God’s law perfectly. The only way for him to be perfect was to follow Jesus and trust that Jesus would save him from his sin.
28:5	c0f9	application			If the young man wanted to have eternal life, why was he not willing to give up his possessions?	Jesus promised that the young man would have treasure in heaven if he followed Jesus. However, the young man could not yet see and touch that treasure. He had to believe that Jesus would reward him. However, he could easily see and touch the possessions that he already had in this world. Therefore, it was hard for him to give up his current treasure to gain something that he could not yet see.
28:6-7	tw49	application			Why were the disciples so shocked to hear that it was almost impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven?	The people of that day believed that if God loved someone, he made them wealthy. The more possessions a person had, the more people thought God loved them. The disciples were shocked to hear that God does not necessarily accept a person who is rich.
28:9-10	nh0p	meaning			If disciples give up things for Jesus’ sake, how much more will they receive from him?	Disciples who give up things for Jesus will receive 100 times as much from him as a reward (See: [28:10](28/10)).

Other people may think they are poor in this life, but Jesus will richly reward them in his kingdom.
28:1-10	xdbi	summary				The rich young ruler who came to Jesus genuinely wanted to receive eternal life. He thought that he had obeyed God enough to be worthy of eternal life. Jesus loved him, but also knew that the young man loved his possessions. Therefore, Jesus tested him by telling him to give up his possessions and to follow Jesus in order to have eternal life. However, this made the young man very sad. The disciples were surprised that Jesus did not accept the rich young man. But Jesus explained that he would reward the disciples who gave up their wealth for his sake.
29:1	y438	meaning			What did Jesus mean when he told Peter to forgive his brother 70 times seven?	When Jesus told Peter to forgive his brother 70 times seven, he wanted to say that Peter should forgive his brother as many times as necessary without stopping (See: [29:1](29/01)).
29:2	mdm5	meaning			Would the servant ever be able to repay the money he owed to the king?	Since the servant owed 200,000 years’ wages, he would not be able to repay the king in his lifetime (See: [29:2](29/02).
29:3	z6tz	meaning			How would the king get his money back by selling the servant and his family as slaves?	The king would take the money that he would receive from selling the man and his family as slaves. This money would be a partial payment toward what the servant owed the king (See: [29:3](29/03)).
29:5-6	elig	meaning			Would the servant who owed four months’ wages be able to repay the other servant?	The servant who owed four months’ wages might have been able to repay the other servant if he had time to earn the money (See: [29:5](29/05), [29:6](29/06)).
29:7	nvdz	meaning			Why were the other servants disturbed by what happened?	The other servants thought the servant whom the king forgave had treated the other servant unfairly. He should have forgiven the other servant (See: [29:7](29/07)).
29:8	ogtk	meaning			Why was the king so angry?	The king was angry because he had forgiven the debt of the servant, but now he saw that the servant was a wicked man. He was not willing to forgive other people as the king had forgiven him (See: [29:8](29/08)).
29:8	ce4p	meaning			For how long did the king put the wicked servant into prison?	The king put the servant into the prison until he could repay his debt. However, his debt was so large that he would never be able to repay it. Therefore, he would be in prison for the rest of his life (See: [29:8](29/08)).
29:9	cxcz	meaning			Why did Jesus tell this story?	Jesus wanted his disciples to know that God had forgiven them, and that he expected them to forgive each other in the same way (See: [29:9](29/09)).
29:1	mjbh	application			Why do you think Peter offered to forgive his brother seven times?	Peter apparently thought that he was being merciful if he forgave his brother seven times. That seemed like a lot to Peter. However, Jesus answered that seven times was not enough. Disciples of Jesus should forgive 70 times more than that. That is, they should forgive their brothers without limit.
29:2,5	l2d3	application			How did the debts of the two servants compare to each other?	The debt of the first servant was so large that it would be impossible to repay. The debt of the second servant was significant, but not impossible to pay.
29:2-8	vpv5	application			Who do you think the king and the servants represent in this story?	In this story, the king represents God. The servants represent the disciples of Jesus. Every disciple owed God a payment for his sin that was impossible to pay, just as the servant owed the king a huge debt. However, God forgave their sin because Jesus died in their places. Therefore, God expects his disciples to forgive each other.
29:9	leyf	application			How will God respond to disciples who do not forgive other disciples?	God will be very angry with disciples who are not willing to forgive other disciples. He will judge them severely.
29:1-9	myod	summary				Peter asked Jesus how many times he should forgive a fellow disciple who sinned against him. He thought that perhaps seven times would be enough. But Jesus told him that he should continue to forgive his brother even 70 times more than that. Jesus then told a story to show that God is like a king who has forgiven his disciples a great debt of sin. Therefore, his disciples should also forgive their fellow disciples. The debt that they owe each other is much less than the debt they owed to God. If his disciples do not forgive each other, God will be angry with them and will punish them.

30:2-3	c3pm	application			How did Jesus respond to the crowd when they interrupted him and the disciples as they were going to a place to rest?	Even though Jesus wanted the disciples to rest, he was not angry with the crowds that followed them. Instead, he felt compassion on the people. Even though he and his disciples needed to rest, they taught and healed the people in the crowd.
30:4-5	wika	application			Why did Jesus tell the disciples to give the crowd something to eat?	Jesus knew that they did not have enough food to feed the crowd. He told the disciples to feed them so that the disciples would understand that it was impossible to do that.

They would know that God had worked through him in a mighty way.
30:8	y25m	application			Who caused the food to increase?	Jesus was the one who caused the food to increase and satisfy all the people.

30:9	xybt	application			Why do you think the disciples collected the leftover food?	Jesus wanted the disciples to see how much he had multiplied the food. The leftover food was more than the five loaves of bread and two fish that they had at the beginning. Those would fit into a single basket. But now there were 12 full baskets. Each of the 12 disciples had a full basket of leftover food.
30:1-9	y22v	summary				Jesus’ disciples were tired from preaching and teaching about Jesus. Jesus knew they needed rest, so he took them in a boat to a quiet place. However, thousands of people who wanted to see Jesus ran ahead to that place. But Jesus was not angry with them. Instead, he felt compassion for them. They did not have anyone to teach then and to care for them, so he did that. Even though there was not enough for the people to eat, Jesus multiplied the small amount of food they had and gave it to his disciples to give to the people. The food fed all of the people as much as they wanted to eat. The disciples had more food left over than they had before they fed the people. Jesus took the small amount of food that they had and enabled them to meet the needs of the entire crowd with it. Only God can do that.

31:5-6	ok0c	application			Why do you think it was wise for Peter to try to walk on the water to Jesus?	Peter often did not think carefully about things before he did them.

They all remained in the boat and waited for Jesus to come to them.
31:7	plia	application			Why did Jesus say that Peter had little faith?	Peter began to trust Jesus. He asked to Jesus to cause him to walk on the water. That shows that Peter believed in Jesus.

33:9	ghzn	application			How does a person produce 30, 60 or 100 times as much fruit?	A single person can cause many other people to hear about Jesus and to love God. This may not happen all at once. But if they obey God throughout their lives and tell others about him, many people will respond to their testimony. The people may be their family, their friends, or even total strangers.
33:1-9	p1hs	summary				A large crowd came to hear Jesus teach. There were so many people that he had to get into a boat in the water so that he had room to speak to them all. The people in the crowd would respond to his words in different ways. Some would not understand at all. Others would believe for a while and then fade away. But some would believe his words and serve God for their entire lives. For this reason, Jesus told the story about a farmer sowing seed. The seed fell on different kinds of soil, and it grew in different ways. The seed on the different kinds of soil represented the different people in the crowd. Jesus was telling the crowd and his disciples that they should pay attention to whether they believed the word of God. They should also make sure that they did not let anything else in their lives take the place of their love for God. If they continued to believe, they would accomplish much for God.

The stories of the mustard seed and the yeast showed that the kingdom of God will begin small, but will become larger than all other kingdoms, filling the whole earth.

Jesus knew that he would make Lazarus alive again. Jesus perhaps said Lazarus was asleep in order to show that his death was temporary.

37:2	j1mc	application			Why were the disciples surprised that Jesus wanted to go to Lazarus in Judea?	The Jewish leaders in Judea wanted to kill Jesus. However, Jesus was not afraid to die. In fact, he came to earth in order to die for sinners. Therefore, he was willing to go to Judea even though he knew they wanted to kill him there.

37:1-11	qqwp	summary				Jesus honored God with everything he did. He was not afraid of people who wanted to kill him. He was willing to allow Lazarus to die even though it made Martha, Mary, and Jesus himself very sad. The most important thing was to honor God. As a result, Martha, Mary, the disciples, and many others saw God work powerfully through Jesus to raise Lazarus to life again.

In fact, they trusted him so much that they put him in charge of their shared money bag. Judas fooled all of the disciples. Jesus alone knew that he would betray Jesus.
38:8-10	uy74	application			Why do you think the disciples did not believe that they would abandon Jesus?	The disciples thought they were brave enough to stand with Jesus. They were offended when he warned them that they would flee. Therefore, they fell asleep instead of watching and praying as Jesus had asked them. As a result, they were not able to stand with him when Judas and the crowd came for Jesus.
38:12	vjzn	application			What does Jesus prayer to his Father in the garden teach us about doing God’s will?	Jesus did not want to suffer and die, and asked his Father to spare him.

38:14	ymhw	application			Why did the Jewish leaders need Judas to betray Jesus?	Jesus taught publicly every day, but the Jewish leaders were afraid to arrest him in front of the crowds who came to listen to him.

38:15	jg81	application			Why do you think Peter struck the servant of the high priest with his sword?	Peter did not understand that Jesus must die for sinners.

He did not want his servants to prevent his arrest.
38:1-15	dniw	summary				Jesus knew that the Passover meal represented the way Jesus would suffer and die for sinners. He explained this to his disciples, but they did not understand him or believe that he would die. None of the disciples prayed or prepared for the time when Jesus would be betrayed.

That was the reason for which he came into the world.

39:3-4	vb0u	meaning			What question did the high priest ask Jesus, and how did Jesus answer?	The high priest asked if Jesus was the Messiah, and the Son of the living God. Jesus told the high priest that this was who he was (See: [39:3](39/03), [39:4](39/04)).

39:12	t2d5	meaning			Why did Pilate tell his soldiers to crucify Jesus?	Pilate was afraid the crowd would riot, so he ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus in order to satisfy the crowd. Therefore, they whipped Jesus and prepared to kill him (See: [39:12](39/12)).
39:3-4	wqrb	application			What was the only charge the high priest was able to bring against Jesus?	Jesus had not done anything wrong, so the high priest could not find true witnesses against him. Finally, he accused Jesus of pretending to be the Messiah and the Son of God. Jesus really was God’s Son, so he was not pretending. He was innocent, but the high priest would not believe him. Therefore, the whole group of religious leaders condemned Jesus.
39:6-8	pcjt	application			How is it encouraging to followers of Jesus that Peter denied Jesus?	Peter was one of Jesus’ closest disciples. He truly believed in Jesus, and became a leader in the church. However, even Peter denied Jesus when the people accused him. No believer is perfect. Jesus does not expect us to always do the right thing. Just as Jesus loved Peter in spite of his failure, followers of Jesus know he will forgive them when they repent of their sin.
39:10-12	dby3	application			Why do you think God allowed Jesus to be falsely accused and condemned?	God knows that our fallen nature causes us to sin. His Holy Spirit enables people to do his will. By dying, Jesus took the place of sinners, accepting God's judgment of sin on himself, even though he was without sin. Paying the penalty for our sin, he made it possible for God to forgive sinners. So God allowed the Jewish leaders and the Romans to convict Jesus even though they knew he was innocent. Evil actions do not stop God’s plan or his will from happening.

Peter denied that he knew Jesus. And Pilate ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus even though he knew that Jesus was innocent. But God used all of these evil things to accomplish his plan.

40:2	xgr9	application			Why do you think Jesus said the soldiers did not know what they were doing?	The soldiers were Romans who did not know very much about the Jewish religion. They probably thought Jesus was an ordinary criminal, and they treated him as one.
40:3	uy7z	application			They soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing. Why does that help us believe Jesus was the Messiah?	This action was one of many things that the scriptures, written hundreds of years before, said they would do to the Messiah. All these prophesies were fulfilled in Jesus.
40:4	i5pt	application			Jesus told the robber who repented that he would be with Jesus in Paradise that day. What does that tell us about the way to enter into heaven?	The robber did not perform a single good deed. Instead, he simply confessed that he was a sinner, and asked Jesus to remember him in the kingdom. As a result, Jesus promised that he would be in Paradise (that is, heaven) that same day. The way to enter into heaven is to believe in Jesus.
40:5	fzbu	application			Why do you think Jesus did not come down from the cross and save himself when the people asked him to?	The people who told Jesus to come down from the cross did not want to believe in him. They were only mocking him. They did not realize that he had the power to come down from the cross. But he came to earth to die for sinners. That was the will of his Father. He had to stay on the cross and give up his own life in order to make it possible for God to forgive other people who believed in Jesus.
40:7	o1hl	application			What was finished when Jesus cried out?	When Jesus cried out, “It is finished!” he wanted to say that he had finished paying the penalty for the sins of everyone in the world. It was now possible for God to forgive those who repented and trusted in Jesus. People no longer needed to die for their own sins.
40:7	ems9	application			Why was the curtain of the Temple torn from top to bottom?	The curtain of the Temple prevented people from seeing or entering into the most holy place in the Temple where God was. God in heaven above tore the curtain from the top to the bottom when Jesus died. He did this to show that Jesus had opened a way for man to approach God through the sacrifice of Jesus.
40:8	tsaq	application			Why did the soldier say that Jesus was innocent, and the Son of God?	The Roman soldier had probably executed hundreds of criminals. He recognized that Jesus did not act like a criminal. Instead, he was a good man who asked his Father to forgive the soldiers, and who spoke kindly to the robber who repented. Furthermore, the miraculous signs that happened when Jesus died convinced the soldier that Jesus was not just a man—he was the Son of God.
40:1-9	suof	summary				Jesus suffered greatly as he died. The soldiers mocked and mistreated him. The religious leaders and the crowd mocked him. Even one of the robbers on a cross beside him mocked him. Despite this, Jesus remained on the cross and suffered in order to make a way for God to forgive sinners. He was willing to die in order to obey his Father and finish the task that he came to do. One of the robbers understood this, and went to heaven with Jesus. One of the soldiers also saw that Jesus was truly the Son of God. And two of the religious leaders believed in Jesus and honored him by burying his body. God was honored even through the death of his Son.
41:1	q7tl	meaning			What were the Jewish leaders afraid the disciples would do with the body of Jesus?	They were afraid the disciples would steal Jesus’ body and say he had risen from the dead (See: [41:1](41/01)).

41:4	sx58	meaning			Who rolled the stone away from the tomb?	An angel from heaven rolled the stone away from the tomb (See: [41:4](41/04)).
41:4	r7d7	meaning			What did the soldiers do when they saw the angel?	The soldiers were so afraid that they fell to the ground like dead men (See: [41:4](41/04)).
41:5	yjax	meaning			What did the angel tell the women had happened to Jesus?	The angel told them that Jesus was not there, but that he had risen from the dead (See: [41:5](41/05)).

41:1	c5pd	application			Who was it that remembered Jesus’ promise to rise from the dead in three days?	It is surprising that the disciples did not remember the Jesus said he would rise from the dead in three days. Instead, it was the unbelieving Jewish leaders who remembered what he said. They did not believe him, but they did remember his words. The disciples should have remembered.
41:2-4	htc1	application			Were the soldiers able to prevent the tomb from opening?	The Roman soldiers were the best soldiers of that time. However, they could not stand against the single angel that God sent to open the tomb. The strongest military force could not stop God from doing what he planned to do. When the angel appeared, they fell down like dead men.
41:5-6	ta7g	application			How did the angel treat the women who came to the tomb?	The angel knew that the women had come to honor Jesus by putting spices on his body. Therefore, the angel spoke kindly to them and told them not to be afraid. He showed them the empty tomb, and told them that Jesus would meet them in Galilee.
41:8	gxy0	application			Why do you think Jesus met the women, when he told them the same thing as the angel?	Jesus did not need to appear to the women. The angel had already told them that he was alive and would meet the disciples in Galilee. But Jesus also knew that the women had come to honor him. Perhaps he appears to them for that reason, so he could honor them for coming to serve him. The women were therefore the first people to see Jesus after he became alive again.
41:1-8	eg8u	summary				Jesus had told the disciples and other people the he would become alive again after three days. Surprisingly, the disciples did not remember this, nor come to the tomb to see if he would rise again. Only the women came, and even they did not expect Jesus to be alive. The only people who seemed to remember that he promised to rise again were the unbelieving religious leaders. They remembered what Jesus said, and tried to stop people from believing that he would rise from the dead. They posted soldiers to make sure his body remained in the tomb. But they could not stop the plan of God. An angel struck down the soldiers, and Jesus rose with power.
42:1	fe8f	meaning			What were the two disciples talking about as they went to a nearby town?	They were talking about what had happened to Jesus. The women had said Jesus was alive, so they did not know what to believe (See: [42:1](42/01)).

42:5	hn2j	meaning			How did Jesus convince the disciples in Jerusalem that he was not a ghost?	He showed them his hands and feet, and then ate a piece of fish before them (See: [42:5](42/05)).

42:1-2	p627	application			Why do you think the two disciples on the road did not believe that Jesus had risen from the dead?	They had thought Jesus was the Messiah, so it was very difficult and discouraging for them when he died. Perhaps they did not want to believe the report from the women so that they would not be disappointed again if Jesus was not really alive.
42:2	vihl	application			Why do you think the two disciples did not recognize Jesus?	It seems as if Jesus prevented the two disciples from recognizing him. Perhaps he wanted them to believe the things the prophets had written about him in God’s word before he revealed himself to them. From the time Jesus went back to heaven, people have not been able to see him, and must believe in him because of what God’s word says about him.
42:6	q6l8	application			Why did the disciples in Jerusalem not believe Jesus was alive when he first appeared to them?	Jesus had told the disciples that he would become alive again after three days. The woman had also seen him alive at the tomb and told the disciples. And the two disciples who saw Jesus on the road told them that Jesus was alive. Even so, when Jesus appeared among them in the room, they thought he was a ghost. It is amazing that they did not believe he was alive even with so much proof. They only understood clearly after Jesus explained to them the things written about him in God’s word.
42:8	qiol	application			What must people do in order for God to forgive them?	People must repent in order for God to forgive them.

42:1-11	fgtr	summary				The disciples did not understand that the Messiah had to die for the sins of people. Therefore, they were so discouraged when Jesus died that it was difficult for them to believe that he was alive again—even when there was so much proof that he was alive. However, Jesus appeared alive to many of the disciples over a period of 40 days in order to prove to them from the word of God that he was the Messiah and had risen from the dead. He them sent the Holy Spirit to give them power so they could tell people everywhere to repent, believe in him, and obey all that he commanded us. Meanwhile, he is sitting at the right hand of God and ruling over everything.

43:1	wvu2	application			What was the main thing the believers continually did when they gathered together?	Prayer was very important to the believers. They continually gathered together to pray to God as a group, in addition to praying individually. Perhaps that is why God did such powerful works among them.
43:3-4	nt9o	application			How did the gift of speaking in other languages help the believers proclaim the message of Jesus?	The people in Jerusalem knew the believers could not speak the native languages of everyone in the crowd. When they heard and saw them do this, they knew it was a miracle.

43:6-9	ks4x	application			What did Peter tell the crowd about Jesus?	Peter told them that they had crucified Jesus, but that God had raised him from the dead just as the prophets had said he would.

43:10	wu2b	application			How did people respond to Peter’s message?	God caused the people to be deeply moved so that they asked Peter what they should do. God will not always cause people to respond in this way, but on that occasion, 3,000 people believed the message and repented.

When everyone in Jerusalem saw how the believers treated each other and praised God, they thought well of them, and many more people became believers.

He enabled them to speak in the native language of every person to whom they spoke. People were amazed at this. They listened to Peter as he told them that Jesus, whom they had crucified, had become Lord and Messiah and had sent the Holy Spirit to do this. When they heard this, 3,000 immediately believed in Jesus and were baptized. As they continued to meet together, other people saw how they praised God and helped each other. As a result, the church continued to grow.

44:4	qj63	application			Who gave the power to heal the crippled man?	Peter was very careful to tell the people that the power to heal the man did not come from Peter and John. Instead, Jesus healed the man because Peter and John believed in Jesus. Peter and John were very humble about the way God used them.

44:8	p4e5	application			Is there any other way to be saved other than through Jesus?	Peter very clearly told the religious leaders that there is no other way to be saved except through Jesus. The works of the leaders would not save them. No other god could save them. Jesus is the only way.

Philip was preaching in Samaria, and many people were believing in Jesus as a result. However, the Holy Spirit sent Philip away from Samaria to meet only the Ethiopian. It seems that it was so important that the Ethiopian believed that God took Philip away from speaking to many other people. Philip obeyed God and went.
45:8-9	p9lr	application			When Philip approached the Ethiopian, how was it exactly the right time for the Ethiopian to hear about Jesus?	The Ethiopian was reading about the Messiah in the book of the prophet Isaiah, but did not know that Isaiah was writing about Jesus.

Because Philip came to him then, the Ethiopian quickly believed and was baptized.
45:11	anfv	application			Who suggested that the Ethiopian be baptized?	The Ethiopian himself knew that he should honor Jesus by being baptized in his name. Therefore, he asked Philip to baptize him. Philip did that, and the Ethiopian continued on to his home, happy to know Jesus.
45:1-13	aehq	summary				At first, the Jews approved of the followers of Jesus because of the miracles they did and the way they lived. But they soon turned against the believers. They accused Stephen of saying evil things about Moses and God, and then killed him. After that, they persecuted the believers and forced them to leave Jerusalem and scatter to other places. But God used the persecution to cause the believers to proclaim the message about Jesus to everyone everywhere. Many people believed in Jesus at the preaching Philip and others. But God also sought out individual people, such as the Ethiopian official, who needed to hear about Jesus. Even during the persecution, God was at work to powerfully grow his church.

He was perhaps the least likely person we would expect God to save and use for his glory.
46:2	wmm7	application			Why do you think Jesus told Saul that he was persecuting Jesus?	Jesus was already in heaven when Saul began to persecute the believers. But the believers represented Jesus on earth, so when Saul persecuted them, it was as if he was persecuting Jesus himself. Jesus cares about what happens to the believers.

God told Ananias that he had chosen Saul to declare his name to the Jews and to people from other people groups, and to suffer in God’s name.

46:6-7	b4sq	application			What happened in Damascus when Saul preached about Jesus?	Saul argued boldly with the Jews to prove that Jesus was the Son of God.

46:10	ie2p	application			How did the Holy Spirit send out Barnabas and Saul?	The Holy Spirit spoke to the believers in the church at Antioch in order to send out Barnabas and Saul. The church then prayed for them, placed their hands on them, and supported them as they went out to preach among the other people groups. God did not send them out alone. Instead, he worked through the church so the believers were deeply involved in the work of Barnabas and Saul.
46:1-10	f39z	summary				As the Jews continued to persecute the believers, God did an amazing thing. He chose to set apart Saul, one of the worst persecutors of the church, and cause him to preach boldly about Jesus! He appeared to Saul on the road in blazing light, rebuked him, and made Saul blind. As a result, Saul believed in Jesus and began to boldly proclaim his name. When the Jews drove him out of Damascus, he went to Jerusalem and continued to preach there. Later, he went with Barnabas to Antioch and taught the first believers who were not Jews. And finally, God told the church at Antioch to send out Barnabas and Saul to preach to other people groups everywhere. God continued to spread the message of Jesus.
